    <p> Hello! my name is <b>Nicholas Cerillo</b> I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Florida, 
        and I have been living here in Washington state ever since I graduated in 2018.
        I moved from Florida to here so that I could work as a Software Developer for a 
        consultant company called Mindtree Limited. While this job gave me the opportunity 
        to work as a developer at first, circumstances eventually led me to being put into more
        support related roles. Now, a year later, I have decided that I want to get back into development again
        and have decided to join this course to help me relearn some of my lost skills, and 
        help me to build an impressive project portfolio.
